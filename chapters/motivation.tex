The electrical conductivity or resistance is a fundamental characteristic and an accessable observable of metals.
The response of electrons as a consequence of an external applied field is measured by the conductivity and its magnitude is finite due to internal processes.
A first physical explanation describing this circumstances was published by Drude \cite{Drude} in the year 1900.
He supposed the electrons to be free particles moving around in the metal.
As a consequence of scattering, the electrons are assumed to possess a finite relaxation time $\tau$.
This characteristical variable denotes the passing time between to scattering events.
At low temperatures, the electrical conductivity is determined by scattering between electrons and impurities.
Drude's theory demonstrates the fact, that non-conservation of momentum due to relaxation and a finite electrical conductivity are directly associated.
The results of this phenomenological theory are exactly confirmed by using the technique of quantum field theory without considering quantum correction to describe the electrons \cite{Bruus&Flensberg}.
Landau's Fermi liquid theory is the well proven quantum mechanical describtion for metals.
%Metals are well described by Landau's Fermi liquid theory in quantum mechanics.
Electron-electron interaction and interaction between electrons and other degrees of freedom, like umklapp scattering, generates a quadratic temperature dependence of the resistance $\rho(T) = \rho_{0} + A \cdot T^{2}$, where $\rho_{0}$ is the residuary resitiance from impurity scattering \cite{Bader,Pal}.
The consideration of quantum mechanical corrections, like weak localization \cite{Altshuler} and the Kondo effect \cite{Kondo}, modify the temperature dependence further.

In alloys, like $\mt{CeCu}_{6-x}\mt{Au}_{x}$ and $\mt{CeCu}_{6-x}\mt{Ag}_{x}$, a linear temperature dependence of the resistance $\rho(T) = \rho_{0} + A \cdot T$ is found, which is not explainable with Landau's Fermi liquid theory \cite{Loehneysen}.
